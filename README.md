# VueJS UI Reference Implementation

A front-end SPA application built with VueJS. It implements JWT authentication, Vuex for storage and VueRouter for routing.

As of now it goes hand in hand with my other projects such as my
[Car API](https://github.com/PatriQ94/CarAPITemplate), which serve as the back-end for authentication and data retrieval. That being said, in order to fully see the front-end and the back-end working together you need to run both projects at the same time.

**The main purpose of the project is to be used as a reference implementation in case of need.**
