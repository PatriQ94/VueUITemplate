# VueJS UI Reference Implementation

_Work in progress_

A front-end SPA application built with VueJS. It implements JWT authentication, Vuex for storage, VueRouter for routing and Vuetify for UI.

As of now it goes hand in hand with my other projects such as my
[Car API](https://github.com/PatriQ94/CarAPITemplate), which serve as the back-end for authentication and data retrieval. That being said, in order to fully see the front-end and the back-end working together you need to run both projects at the same time.

**The main purpose of the project is to be used as a reference implementation.**

### Build and run

```
